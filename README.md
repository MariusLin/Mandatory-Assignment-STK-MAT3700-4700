# Mandatory Assignment STK-MAT3700



## Information
This repository consists of two folders, one containing all the plots and the other one containing the code for the mandatory assignment in STK-MAT3700/4700. There is one file for the code of each problem, i.e. one file for problem 1 and one file for problem 2. 
As the data used for the calculations is as recent as 11 September 2024, this date was added as end date in the code for problem 1.
